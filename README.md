🌦️ Weather Data Dashboard 🌦️

I'm excited to share a recent project I completed using Power BI! 📊

This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of weather data, including:

Precipitation Type: Breakdown of rain, snow, and no rain occurrences.
Average Wind Bearing: Visualized wind direction.
Max and Min Temperatures: Extremes recorded over the dataset period.
Humidity and Max Wind Speed: Key weather indicators.
Temperature Trends: Historical temperature trends from 2006 to 2016.
Humidity vs. Wind Speed: Relationship between these variables.
Daily Summary: Breakdown of daily weather summaries.

I used this project to improve my data visualization skills and gain deeper insights into weather patterns. 🌐
