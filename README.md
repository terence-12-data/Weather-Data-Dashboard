 Weather Data Analysis Dashboard 

I’m excited to share another project I created using Power BI! 📊

This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of US weather data (2006–2016) and helps analyze key weather patterns and trends.

🔍 Key Insights from the Dashboard:

Precipitation Type – Breakdown of rain, snow, and no-rain occurrences

Average Wind Bearing – Visualization of wind direction trends

Temperature Extremes – Maximum and minimum temperatures over time

Humidity & Wind Speed – Key weather indicators for climate understanding

Temperature Trends (2006–2016) – Long-term shifts in temperature patterns

Humidity vs. Wind Speed – Correlation between these two factors

Daily Summaries – Day-to-day variations in weather conditions

🎯 Objective

The goal of this project was to analyze historical US weather data and build an interactive dashboard to identify patterns, correlations, and anomalies.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Power BI – for visualization & dashboard design

Excel dataset – for data preprocessing and input

✅ Status

Completed

🙌 Credits

Dataset: Kaggle (US Weather Dataset)
